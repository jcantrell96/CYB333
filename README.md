This project aims to develop an all-in-one automation tool for Blue Teams to conduct vulnerability assessments and achieve Authorization to Operate (ATO) certification. The tool will automate key security tasks, including port scanning, malicious packet injection using Scapy, and Windows log collection. By streamlining these tasks, the tool will enable Blue Teams to enhance assessment speed and efficiency, generate reports for stakeholders, and assist in onsite vulnerability mitigation with real-time support.The script was debugged using VSCode and executed on a VirtualBox environment running Kali Linux OS with Python 3. It prompts the user to target a Windows host, sends a malicious packet to the insecure Telnet port (23) via Scapy, scans for open ports, and collects Windows security logs for the specified host.
This approach ensures compliance with regulatory standards while simplifying the vulnerability assessment process.
